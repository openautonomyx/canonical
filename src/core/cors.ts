// Canonical Core — CORS: the one and only trust primitive.
//
// Trust is NOT based on origin. A resource is reachable only when its provider
// has issued an explicit, signed sharing contract. Only CORS is trusted.
//
// A grant IS a contract. Only the provider — the resource owner — holds the
// authority to originate one. Every valid grant chains, by monotone
// attenuation, back to that provider; a consumer only ever holds a delegated
// sub-contract, never authority of its own.
